## XOR Cipher

### Description

Write a simple python program that reads a file and, receives a key. Then encodes the file with the given key using the XOR-Cipher.  
To test the functionality of the program, you need to pass the encrypted file to the program again and use the same key to decrypt it. If the file is successfully decrypted, the program is working ok, otherwise, it is not.

### Details

You need to pass either the relative or the absoloute path of the file to your proram. In addition, you also need to enter a key. This key can be a decimal number or a string. For example both `1234` and `'abcd1234'` are acceptable as key.
Note that you must __replace__ the contents of the given file in order to encrypt it. Making a new file is __not acceptable__.  
> You can use `ex1-1.jpg` file to check your program.  

Sample inputs:

```python
>>>
File Path: ./myfile.jpg
Successfully read the file.
Key: myKey
Key is accepted
File ciphered successfully
```

### Hints

There are a few hidden points to this question which you may need to take into consideration.  
First is the matter of reading the file. You can either read it in binary format or ASCII. Examine both to see which one suits you better.  
The second is the problem of key length. For example, you may enter a key with a length of 5 or a length of 10. This causes an issue with the cipher algorithm especially when you need to rewrite the file. You need to find a solution to this problem as well.
